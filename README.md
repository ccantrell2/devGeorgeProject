  <h2>A User Story</h2>

  I created this application to keep track of what I do everyday. I wanted to keep a kinda virtual diary, so I can go back and see what I did. I wanted to do this so I could be nostalgic if I wanted to or more importantly, I can go back and see if I did things that I was supposed to do. I decided to create this app for my first web dev project. It went well the first time, so i decided to bring it back for my last web dev project. Here is an example of what my app looks like:
